 * @description
 * p5.brush is a p5.js library dedicated to the creation and management of custom brushes.
 * It extends the drawing capabilities of p5.js by allowing users to simulate a wide range
 * of brush strokes, vector fields, hatching patterns, and fill textures. These features
 * are essential for emulating the nuanced effects found in traditional sketching and painting.
 * Whether for digital art applications or procedural generation of graphics, p5.brush provides
 * a robust framework for artists and developers to create rich, dynamic, and textured visuals.
 *
 * @example
 * // Basic usage:
 * brush.pick('marker'); // Select brush type
 * brush.stroke(255, 0, 0); // Set brush color
 * brush.strokeWeight(10); // Set brush size
 * brush.line(25, 25, 75, 75); // Draw a line
 * 
 * // Add a new brush type:
 * brush.add('customBrush', { /* parameters for the brush *\/ });
 * brush.pick('customBrush');
 * 
 * // Use the custom brush for a vector-field line:
 * brush.field('field_name') // Pick a flowfield
 * brush.flowLine(50, 50, 100, PI / 4); // Draw a line within the vector-field
 *
 * // Fill textures:
 * brush.noStroke();
 * brush.fill('#FF0000', 90); // Set fill color to red and opacity to 90
 * brush.bleed(0.3); // Set bleed effect for a watercolor-like appearance
 * brush.rect(100, 100, 50, 50); // Fill a rectangle with the bleed effect
